## Interfacing python and c++

### Compiling with pybind

- Using the vcpkg toolchain is problematic because there are mismatches in python versions. 
- Best results have been obtained using the pybind as a submodule. This submodule provides a CMake macro to create modules with the correct extension `pybind11_add_module(luis_example example.cpp)`
- This compiles a dynamic library with `.pyd` extension.
- The library can be directly used as a submodule with `import`.


### Compiling with SWIG (Windows).
1. Install `swigwin` for windows: <https://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Windows.html>
2. Run `swig -c++ -python example.i` to generate the `example_wrap.cxx` and `example.py` files.
3. Use `example_wrap.cxx` and `example.cxx` to compile a **shared** library. Compilation must be in **release** mode.
4. The name of the shared library must start with underscore and have suffix `.pyd`. e.g. `_example.pyd`. It must be located at the same place as the `example.py` generated by swig.
